## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us directly at: **Eg2@live.com**
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have released a fix
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for malicious purposes

### Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep our users safe. With your permission, we will:
- Credit you in our security advisories
- List you in our hall of fame (if you're interested)

## Security Best Practices

When deploying AI Translator:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy behind a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
2. **Strong Passwords**: Change default passwords immediately
3. **Network Security**: Restrict access to trusted networks when possible
4. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check application and system logs
6. **Backup Security**: Secure your database backups
7. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file system permissions

## Known Security Considerations

- AI Translator requires significant system privileges for media processing
- GPU access requires elevated permissions
- Database contains potentially sensitive media metadata
- API endpoints require proper authentication

For more information, see our [Security Configuration Guide](security_config.py).
